# Distributed LiDAR: Low-Cost Full-Angle Laser Range Finder

This project is focused on developping low-cost full-angle range finder to be able to replace recently commonly-used expensive depth cameras or LiDARs.

One of the product from the project is a highly flexible range finder sensor which conduct laser through optical fibers. It's so flexible that can be embedded inside propeller guards to provide full-angle collision detection for drones.

We have another model of which its circuit is made by flexible material. It can be mounted on any surface where safety operation is needed, or turned in to a wearable device.
